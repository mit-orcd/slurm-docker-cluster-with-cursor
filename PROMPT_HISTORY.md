# Prompt History

This file documents the prompts used to create and modify this project.

## Initial Project Setup

1. "Hi - Can you start a new project for me"
   - Created initial project structure
   - Set up basic files and directories

2. "add the new project alongside this one please. The new project is about writing some python to generate docker-compose files."
   - Created Docker Compose generator project
   - Set up initial Python files and templates

3. "Can you write some python that has a Jinja template for generating a file like the docker compose example below. In the python can you template the "c00" sections so that a loop can iterate to generate a specified number of them, where the number is an input parmeter to the python with a defaul value of four."
   - Created Jinja2 template for Docker Compose generation
   - Implemented configurable compute node generation
   - Added Python script for template rendering

4. "what is the right way to set up a github repository for this project. I have a github organization I would like to use and can create a repo by hand. Is it OK for me to then update the directory from the terminal or is it better to allow cursor to do that?"
   - Set up GitHub repository structure
   - Added .gitignore and LICENSE files
   - Initialized git repository

5. "I have created the repo and added an origin as git@github.com:mit-orcd/slurm-docker-cluster-with-cursor.git . Using the ssh URL lets me access using a key that I can add to the MacOS keyring."
   - Connected local repository to GitHub
   - Set up SSH-based authentication

6. "hmmm - when I try "pytest tests/" I get the following [error message]"
   - Fixed Python package structure
   - Added __init__.py files
   - Created setup.py
   - Updated import paths

7. "can you make the 24GB memory limit for the login node an input parameter too and have it default to 24GB if it is not set."
   - Added configurable login node memory
   - Updated template and Python code
   - Added tests for new functionality

8. "can you create an examples directory with a python driver that generates an example docker-compse file that remains after the program is run. The example should have defaults but also support use of the commoan line options that are availqble."
   - Created examples directory
   - Added example driver script
   - Added example documentation

9. "Actually can you create a sub-directory called example_basic_cluster in the examples directory and move the current example content into that sub-directory. When you do this can you update any code as needed to ensure paths still work."
   - Reorganized examples into subdirectories
   - Updated file paths and documentation
   - Maintained functionality

10. "can you add the file /Users/cnh/projects/hpc-toolset/simple-cluster/Dockerfile to the example_basic_cluster sub-directory"
    - Added Dockerfile to example
    - Updated documentation
    - Integrated Dockerfile with example

11. "can you update the README.md in example_basic_cluster. The "docker build -t slurm-cluster ." step is not needed. The generated yaml file will look for the file Dockerfie in directory . and that will set up the needed image."
    - Updated documentation
    - Removed unnecessary build step
    - Clarified Dockerfile usage

12. "Can you create a file called "PROMPT_HISTORY.md" that contains each propt used so far in this project. Can you place that in the git root directory for the project and then generate commands to add it to github."
    - Created this prompt history file
    - Documented project evolution
    - Prepared for GitHub commit

## Network and Node Configuration Updates

13. "can you modify the Docker Compose Jinja template to include a second internal network named "inband" that all nodes will connect to."
    - Added inband network to all nodes
    - Updated network configuration in template
    - Maintained existing compute network

14. "can you make the node name format use %04d for the compute nodes"
    - Updated compute node naming to use 4-digit format
    - Changed from c001 to node0001 format
    - Updated volume names to match new format

15. "can you make the prefix "login" used for the login node type a parameter that can be changed in the python that generates the docker compose file"
    - Added configurable login node prefix
    - Updated Python code with new parameter
    - Added command-line option for prefix

16. "can you adjust the docker compose jinja so that all the machines created will be addressable on the inband network as MACHINE_NAME.inband where MACHINE_NAME is , for exmaple, "login001" or "node0001"."
    - Added hostname aliases for inband network
    - Implemented MACHINE_NAME.inband format
    - Updated network configuration for all nodes

17. "can you add one more network called "ib" that is similar to "inband" i.e. all the machines are attached to that network and machines have addresses that resolve to MACHINE_NAME.ib on that network."
    - Added ib network configuration
    - Implemented MACHINE_NAME.ib hostname format
    - Updated all nodes to connect to new network

18. "can you update the github repository"
    - Committed all changes to git
    - Created and pushed v0.1.0 tag
    - Updated repository documentation

19. "can you update the jinja to generate a set of "ldap" machines called ldapNNN where NNN is a sequence number starting at 001. By default the python should generate a docker compose file with just one ldap machine. There should be a command line parameter that can be passed to the python code that can set a different number of ldap machines. There should always be at least one ldap machine."
    - Added LDAP node generation
    - Implemented configurable number of LDAP nodes
    - Added validation for minimum one LDAP node
    - Updated Python code with new parameter
    - Added command-line option for LDAP nodes

- Modified SSH volume configuration:
  - Removed read-only flag from root_ssh volume mounts
  - Enabled write access for root user to SSH configuration
